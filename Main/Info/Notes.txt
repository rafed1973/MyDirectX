Work Flow
======================================================================================
1.	Include the direct x dependencies in one .h file.
2.	Make sure you can declare com pointers in an easy way.
	MS way is not preferred. This was done using third party .h file 
	to declare com pointers.
3.	Get the debug layer setup in separate .h and .cpp files
4.	Create the device.
5.	Declare command queue descriptor (needed to create command queue)
	and setup its attributes.
6.	Create command queue.
7. Created a fence and fence value
8. Created a method for the command queue to wait if the fence have not
	the (desired value) created a windows event and waited for it to trigger
9. Created a command list which is like fornt end and created command list allocator
	Command Allocator does not cleared until the list is done with by the GPU
10. Creating a window since we are ready to populate the command list
11. Create a window class then create a window to draw on
12. Attach the window to swapchain. The creation of swap chaing is done after the window creation
	in this example it is in window init. To create swap chain we need dxgi factory which is responsible
	for accessing several dxgi features. we did not need it before this step.
	Swap chaing is created using the factory and not the device
