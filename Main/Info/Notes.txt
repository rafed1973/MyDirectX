Work Flow
1.	Include the direct x dependencies in one .h file.
2.	Make sure you can declare com pointers in an easy way.
	MS way is not preferred. This was done using third party .h file 
	to declare com pointers.
3.	Get the debug layer setup in separate .h and .cpp files
4.	Create the device.
5.	Declare command queue descriptor (needed to create command queue)
	and setup its attributes.
6.	Create command queue.
